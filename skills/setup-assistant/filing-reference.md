# USPTO Filing Reference

This document contains current USPTO filing information for patent application assembly.
Agents and commands MUST reference this document instead of generating filing details from memory.

## Filing System

All new nonprovisional utility patent applications are filed through **USPTO Patent Center** (patentcenter.uspto.gov). EFS-Web was retired in 2023 and is no longer available.

## Document Format Requirements

### Specification, Claims, and Abstract
- **Required format: DOCX**
- Patent Center accepts DOCX natively for specification, claims, and abstract
- Filing in non-DOCX format (e.g., PDF) triggers a **non-DOCX surcharge**
- Convert from Markdown to DOCX before filing (use pandoc or Word)

### Drawings
- **Required format: PDF (black-and-white line art)**
- Utility patent drawings must be black-and-white per 37 CFR 1.84
- Color drawings require a separate petition under 37 CFR 1.84(a)(2) with justification
- Each sheet numbered consecutively within the sight area ("Sheet X of Y")
- Margins: at least 1 inch top, 2.5 cm sides and bottom
- All text in figures must be legible at reduction

### Reference Numerals (37 CFR 1.84(p))
- Every reference numeral appearing in a drawing MUST be mentioned in the specification
- Reference characters not mentioned in the description shall not appear in the drawings
- Consistent numbering: the same element must use the same numeral across all figures
