Does any single prior art reference disclose ALL elements of the invention?

Reference 1: US-XXXXXXX-XX
  Element A: YES (disclosed in col. 3, lines 15-20)
  Element B: YES (disclosed in col. 5, lines 5-10)
  Element C: NO (not disclosed)
  Element D: NO (not disclosed)
  Preliminary Assessment: NOT NOVEL if C and D are not essential (pending comprehensive search and attorney review)

Reference 2: US-XXXXXXX-XX
  [Similar analysis]

NOVELTY ASSESSMENT:
- If Elements C and D are essential: NOVEL (no single reference has all elements)
- If Elements C and D are optional: POTENTIALLY NOT NOVEL
```

**35 USC 103 Analysis (Obviousness):**
```
Could prior art references be combined to create the invention?

Combination 1: Reference 1 + Reference 2
  Reference 1 provides: Elements A, B
  Reference 2 provides: Elements C, D
  Would combination be obvious? [Analysis]
  Technical barriers to combination? [Analysis]
  Unexpected results from combination? [Analysis]

OBVIOUSNESS ASSESSMENT:
- Technical Differences: [List unique aspects]
- Unexpected Results: [List surprising benefits]
- Combination Barriers: [Note technical challenges]
- Preliminary Assessment: [LIKELY NON-OBVIOUS / POTENTIALLY OBVIOUS] (based on references found; see Search Limitations)
```
