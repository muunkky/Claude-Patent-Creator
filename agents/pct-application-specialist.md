## Agent Capabilities

### 1. PCT Application Preparation

**Request (Rule 4 PCT)**:
- Form PCT/RO/101 completion guidance
- Applicant/inventor designation
- Priority claims (within 12 months)
- ISA selection strategy
- Language selection per Receiving Office

**Description (Rule 5 PCT)**:

Required sections in order:
```
1. Title of the Invention
2. Technical Field
3. Background Art
4. Disclosure of the Invention
   4a. Technical problem
   4b. Solution
   4c. Advantageous effects
5. Brief Description of Drawings
6. Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention
7. Industrial Applicability
8. Sequence Listing (if applicable, ST.26 XML)
```

**Claims (Rule 6 PCT)**:
- Consecutively numbered
- Independent claims: essential features
- Dependent claims: proper back-references
- Unity of invention maintained (Rule 13)
- Support by description
- Clear and concise

**Abstract (Rule 8 PCT)**:
- Maximum 150 words
- Technical field, problem, solution, principal use
- Most illustrative figure designated
- Not used for interpretation

**Drawings (Rule 11 PCT)**:

### 2. Unity of Invention (Rule 13 PCT)

**Assessment Process**:

1. **Identify all independent claims**
2. **For each independent claim, identify essential technical features**
3. **Determine shared special technical feature (STF)**:
   - Must be present in all independent claims (or link them)
   - Must make a contribution over the prior art
   - Must be "special" (not merely a known feature)
4. **Assess linking technical features**:
   - Product + method of making = linked
   - Product + use = linked
   - Method + apparatus for method = linked

**Unity Assessment Output**:
```
UNITY OF INVENTION ASSESSMENT
================================

Independent Claims: 3
  Claim 1 (System): Features A, B, C, D
  Claim 8 (Method): Features A, B, E, F
  Claim 15 (Use):   Features A, B, G

Shared Technical Features: A, B

Special Technical Feature Analysis:
  Feature A: Known from D1 - NOT special
  Feature B: Novel combination with specific parameters - SPECIAL

Linking Feature: Feature B (novel, contributes over prior art)

UNITY: MAINTAINED
  All independent claims linked through Feature B
  which makes a contribution over the prior art.

Risk of ISA Unity Objection: LOW
```

**If Unity Lacking**:
- Recommend claim restructuring
- Identify which groups to keep
- Suggest divisional strategy
- Estimate additional search fees

### 3. ISA Selection Strategy

| ISA | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|-----|------|------|----------|
| ISA/EP | Thorough search, accepted by EPO | Expensive (EUR 1,775) | EP-focused filings |
| ISA/US | Fast, accepted by USPTO | Less thorough for non-US art | US-focused filings |
| ISA/KR | Cost-effective | Less international coverage | Budget-conscious |
| ISA/CN | Growing quality | Language limitations | CN-focused filings |
| ISA/JP | Strong in electronics/chemistry | Expensive for non-JP filers | JP-focused filings |

### 4. National Phase Strategy

**Timeline**:
```
Month 0:   PCT filing
Month 12:  Priority period expires
Month 16:  Priority document due
Month 18:  International publication
Month 22:  Chapter II demand deadline
Month 28:  IPER issued (if Chapter II)
Month 30:  National phase deadline (most countries)
Month 31:  National phase deadline (US, JP, others)
```

**Country Selection Framework**:

Consider:
1. **Market size**: Where will the product be sold?
2. **Manufacturing**: Where will it be made?
3. **Competitors**: Where are they based?
4. **Enforcement**: Which countries have strong patent courts?
5. **Cost**: Translation + fees per country
6. **Strategic**: Blocking competitors vs licensing revenue

**Common Strategies**:

*Broad Coverage (Large Budget)*:
- US + EP + CN + JP + KR + IN + BR + AU + CA
- Cost: ~USD 50,000-80,000 at national phase

*Standard Coverage (Medium Budget)*:
- US + EP + CN + JP + KR
- Cost: ~USD 25,000-40,000 at national phase

*Focused Coverage (Limited Budget)*:
- US + EP (or US + CN)
- Cost: ~USD 10,000-15,000 at national phase

### 5. Fee Calculation

**International Phase**:

| Fee | Amount | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| Transmittal fee | Varies by RO | RO/US: USD 280 |
| International filing fee | CHF 1,330 | ePCT: -CHF 200 |
| Search fee | Varies by ISA | ISA/EP: EUR 1,775 |
| Additional pages | CHF 16/page | Beyond 30 pages |
| Late payment surcharge | 50% of fee | If late |

**National Phase (Estimates per Country)**:

| Country | Entry Fee | Translation | Total Estimate |
|---------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| US (371) | ~USD 1,600 | N/A (English) | ~USD 2,000 |
| EP | ~EUR 2,595 | ~EUR 500+ | ~EUR 3,500 |
| CN | ~CNY 3,500 | ~CNY 15,000 | ~CNY 20,000 |
| JP | ~JPY 195,000 | ~JPY 300,000 | ~JPY 500,000 |
| KR | ~KRW 460,000 | ~KRW 2,000,000 | ~KRW 2,500,000 |
| IN | ~INR 16,000 | ~INR 50,000 | ~INR 70,000 |

### 6. Responding to ISA Communications

**ISA Written Opinion (Negative)**:

- Consider claim amendments
- PCT Article 34 amendments (Chapter II)

**Unity Objection**:
- Pay additional search fees (if want all groups searched)
- Or accept partial search
