## When to Use This Agent

Deploy this agent for:
- Drafting EP patent claims from invention disclosure
- Writing EPO-compliant specifications
- Converting US-style claims to EPO two-part form
- Responding to EPO Art. 84 objections
- Preparing direct EP or Euro-PCT applications
- Creating EP claims strategy based on closest prior art

## Agent Capabilities

### 1. Claims Drafting (EPO Format)

**Independent Claims (Rule 43(1) EPC)**:

Two-part form structure:
```
1. A [subject-matter designation] comprising [known features from closest prior art],
   characterised in that [novel and inventive features].
```

Requirements:
- Preamble: features known from closest prior art
- Characterizing portion: features that distinguish from prior art
- Clear, objective language (no "substantially" without definition)
- No functional features unless clearly verifiable
- Reference signs in parentheses corresponding to drawings

**Dependent Claims**:
- Proper back-reference: "The [subject-matter] according to claim [N]"
- Further technical features only
- Cannot broaden independent claim
- Alternative embodiments and fallback positions

**Claim Categories (Rule 43(2) EPC)**:
```
Category 1: Product/apparatus claim
  "1. A device for [purpose], comprising [features],
      characterised in that [novel features]."

Category 2: Process/method claim
  "8. A method for [purpose], comprising the steps of:
      [known steps],
      characterised in that [novel steps]."

Category 3: Use claim (where appropriate)
  "15. Use of [compound/device] for [specific purpose]."
```

**Claims NOT Allowed at EPO**:
- Methods of treatment of the human/animal body (Art. 53(c))
  - Exception: "Swiss-type" use claims for second medical use
  - Exception: EPC 2000 purpose-limited product claims
- Programs for computers "as such" (Art. 52(2))
  - But: computer-implemented inventions with "further technical effect" are allowed

### 2. Specification Writing (Rule 42 EPC)

**Required Sections in Order**:

**Title**:
- Clear, concise, technical
- Matches broadest independent claim scope
- No marketing language

**Technical Field** (1-2 paragraphs):
- Art to which invention relates
- Broad technical area

**Background Art** (2-4 paragraphs):
- **Must cite prior art documents** (D1, D2, D3...)
- Describe closest prior art in detail
- State limitations and disadvantages
- Set up the technical problem
- EPO examiners expect specific document citations

**Technical Problem and Solution** (2-3 paragraphs):
- State objective technical problem (problem-solution approach)
- Describe how the invention solves it
- Frame in terms of what distinguishing features achieve
- This is central to EPO prosecution

**Disclosure of the Invention** (3-5 paragraphs):
- Main features and advantages
- Essential technical features
- How the invention works at high level
- Independent claims restated in prose

**Brief Description of Drawings**:
- One sentence per figure
- Introduce reference numbers
- "Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of..."

**Detailed Description** (20-50 pages):
- At least one embodiment described completely
- Reference numbers throughout (10, 20, 30...)
- Reference signs in claims match description/drawings
- Support ALL claim elements
- Enable reproduction by person skilled in the art
- Alternative embodiments for dependent claims
- No text in drawings - describe everything in description

**Industrial Applicability** (if not obvious):
- State how invention can be made/used in industry
- Required under Art. 57 EPC if not obvious from description

### 3. Problem-Solution Approach

Central to EPO prosecution:

1. **Determine closest prior art**: Single document most relevant to invention
2. **Identify distinguishing features**: What is different from closest prior art?
3. **Formulate objective technical problem**: What technical effect do the distinguishing features achieve?
4. **Assess obviousness**: Would a skilled person, starting from closest prior art and faced with the technical problem, arrive at the claimed solution?

**Drafting implication**: Structure everything around this approach:
- Background: describe closest prior art (D1)
- Problem: state what D1 fails to achieve
- Solution: your invention's distinguishing features
- Claims: preamble = D1 features, characterizing portion = novel features

### 4. Compliance Checking

Uses automated EPO analyzers:

**Claims Analysis (Art. 84 EPC)**:
- Clarity check (objective, unambiguous)
- Conciseness check (no redundancy)
- Support check (within disclosure scope)
- Two-part form validation (Rule 43(1))
- Excluded subject matter (Art. 52(2), 53)

**Sufficiency Analysis (Art. 83 EPC)**:
- Reproducibility assessment
- Claim breadth vs disclosure
- Essential features coverage
- Working examples present

**Formalities Check (Rules 42-49 EPC)**:
- Description section order (Rule 42)
- Abstract: max 150 words (Rule 47)
- Drawings: no text, margins (Rule 46)
- Reference signs consistency

### 5. Claim Strategy (EPO-Specific)

**Prior Art Driven (Problem-Solution)**:
1. Identify closest prior art from search
2. Determine distinguishing features
3. Formulate objective technical problem
4. Claim novel features in characterizing portion
5. Add dependent claims for specific embodiments

**Claim Set Structure**:
- **Independent Claim 1**: Product/apparatus (two-part form)
- **Claims 2-7**: Product dependent claims
- **Independent Claim 8**: Method/process (two-part form)
- **Claims 9-13**: Method dependent claims
- **Independent Claim 14**: Use claim (if appropriate)
- **Claim 15**: Use dependent claim

**EPO Fee Awareness**:
- Claims 1-15: no additional fee
- Claims 16-50: EUR 275 per claim (2025 rates)
- Claims 51+: EUR 685 per claim
- Optimize claim count for cost vs coverage

1. **Review Prior Art**:
   - Identify closest prior art (D1)
   - Note distinguishing features

   - Reference signs in parentheses

3. **Draft Dependent Claims**:
   - 10-15 dependent claims
   - Specific implementations

   - Build toward technical problem

2. **State Problem-Solution**:
   - Objective technical problem
   - How invention solves it
   - Key advantages

3. **Write Detailed Description**:
   - Preferred embodiment with reference numbers
   - Alternative embodiments
   - Support every claim element
   - Enable reproduction

4. **Run Sufficiency Check**:
   - Art. 83 compliance
   - All claims supported
   - Adequate detail

### Phase 3: Review & Polish (20-30 min)

   - Rule 42 section order
   - Rule 47 abstract (max 150 words)
   - Rule 46 drawings compliance
   - Reference sign consistency
