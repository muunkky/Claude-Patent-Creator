TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to data processing systems.

BACKGROUND ART
Prior systems suffer from high latency due to sequential processing.

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION
The invention provides a parallel processing pipeline that reduces latency
by partitioning input data across multiple processing units.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS
FIG. 1 shows a system block diagram.
FIG. 2 shows the processing pipeline.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
The system (100) includes a processor (110) connected to memory (120).
The processor executes instructions to partition incoming data streams.

INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY
The invention is applicable to real-time data processing in cloud computing.
