**An AI-powered patent creation and analysis system for Claude Code.**

I built this because I needed to file a patent myself. I used AI to build the system, used the system to file the patent, and it worked. Now it's open source so anyone can use it, whether you're a developer exploring AI tooling or a patent professional looking to speed up your workflow.

In plain terms, this tool lets you:

- **Search patent regulations instantly.** Ask a question about MPEP, 35 USC, 37 CFR, EPC, or PCT rules and get the relevant sections in under a second, with citations.
- **Find prior art across 100M+ patents.** Search Google's BigQuery patent database by keywords, CPC/IPC codes, or full-text queries. Link related patents across jurisdictions with family search.
- **Check your claims for compliance.** Run your draft claims through automated analysis for USPTO (35 USC 112(b)) or EPO (Art. 84 EPC) and get specific feedback on definiteness, two-part form, and structure.
- **Review your full application.** Specification adequacy, formalities, required sections — checked against USPTO, EPO, or PCT standards.
- **Search EP patents with full text.** Get full claims and description text for European patents via the EPO OPS API (not available in BigQuery).
- **Generate patent diagrams.** Block diagrams, flowcharts, and system architectures in patent style, no design tools needed.
- **Draft a complete patent application.** A guided workflow that walks you through the whole process, from invention disclosure to filing-ready documents — for USPTO or EPO filing.

## Quick Start

Pick the path that fits your setup. All three get you to the same place.

### Option A: Claude Code Plugin (Easiest)

If you're already using Claude Code, this is the fastest way in:

```bash
# Add the marketplace and install
/plugin marketplace add RobThePCGuy/Claude-Patent-Creator
/plugin install claude-patent-creator-standalone@claude-patent-creator

# Run setup
/claude-patent-creator-standalone:setup-patent-system
```

### Option B: One-Line Install

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/RobThePCGuy/Claude-Patent-Creator.git && patent-creator setup
```

This handles everything automatically: installs dependencies, detects your GPU, downloads MPEP PDFs (~500MB), builds the search index, and registers the MCP server with Claude Code. Restart Claude Code when it finishes.

### Option C: Manual Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RobThePCGuy/Claude-Patent-Creator.git
cd Claude-Patent-Creator

# Optional: use a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

pip install -e .
patent-creator setup
```

### Verify It Worked

After any install path, run:

```bash
patent-creator health
```

You should see a status report showing which components are ready. If something's off, the output will tell you what to fix.

## What Can I Actually Do With This?

Here are some real examples. You can type these directly in Claude Code and the right skill or tool kicks in automatically.

| What you want to do | What to say | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| Find the MPEP rule on claim definiteness | "Search MPEP for claim definiteness requirements" | Hybrid search returns the most relevant MPEP sections with citations |
| Look for prior art | "Search for patents about neural network training filed in 2024" | BigQuery searches 100M+ patents and returns matching results |
| Check your claims | "Review these claims for 35 USC 112(b) compliance" | Automated analysis flags indefinite terms, missing antecedent basis, structural issues |
| Review a full application | `/full-review` | Runs claims + specification + formalities checks in parallel |
| Create a patent from scratch | `/create-patent` | Guided 6-phase workflow, takes 55-80 min, produces a complete filing package |
| Generate a diagram | "Create a block diagram showing the system architecture" | Generates a patent-style Graphviz diagram |
| Search prior art thoroughly | "Conduct a prior art search for [your invention]" | Automated novelty and freedom-to-operate analysis |

---

## How It Works

The system has two modes that can work independently or together:

**MCP Server** is the engine. It exposes 20+ tools that any MCP-compatible client (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, etc.) can call programmatically. These tools handle search, analysis, and diagram generation.

**Claude Code Plugin** adds the interactive layer. Skills activate automatically based on what you're doing. Agents handle long-running tasks in the background. Slash commands give you quick access to common workflows.

Under the hood, patent regulation search uses a hybrid approach: FAISS vector search finds semantically similar content, BM25 lexical search catches exact terminology matches, and a cross-encoder reranker sorts the combined results by relevance. Patent search goes through Google BigQuery's public patent dataset.

```
You (Claude Code) ──> MCP Server ──> Search / Analysis / Diagrams

     (hybrid RAG)    (100M+ patents)   (diagrams)
```

## Installation Options

<details>
<summary><strong>What the setup wizard does (step by step)</strong></summary>

1. Installs Python package dependencies
2. Detects your hardware (NVIDIA GPU, Apple Silicon, or CPU-only)
3. If a GPU is detected, uninstalls CPU-only PyTorch and installs the GPU version
4. Restarts the setup process with GPU-enabled PyTorch
5. Downloads MPEP, 35 USC, and 37 CFR PDFs (~500MB) from the USPTO
6. Builds the hybrid search index (FAISS + BM25) with GPU acceleration if available
7. Registers the MCP server with Claude Code

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Using a virtual environment (recommended for isolation)</strong></summary>

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

pip install git+https://github.com/RobThePCGuy/Claude-Patent-Creator.git && patent-creator setup
```

If you go this route, remember to activate the venv before running any manual commands. Claude Code handles activation automatically.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Loading as a local plugin (for development)</strong></summary>

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./Claude-Patent-Creator
```

This loads the plugin directly from your local checkout without installing from the marketplace.

</details>

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root (see `.env.example`):

```bash
# Required for BigQuery patent search
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id

# Optional: EPO OPS API (for EP patent full-text search)
# Free registration at https://developers.epo.org
EPO_OPS_KEY=your-consumer-key
EPO_OPS_SECRET=your-consumer-secret

# Optional API keys (for HyDE query expansion)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Optional settings
PATENT_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
PATENT_LOG_FORMAT=human
PATENT_ENABLE_METRICS=true
PATENT_MPEP_USE_HYDE=false
PATENT_MPEP_DEVICE=gpu
PATENT_OPERATION_TIMEOUT=300
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Setting up BigQuery (optional, for patent search)</strong></summary>

BigQuery gives you access to 100M+ worldwide patents. It requires a Google Cloud project with billing enabled (the public patent dataset itself is free to query within BigQuery's free tier).

```bash
# 1. Install Google Cloud SDK
# https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install

# 2. Authenticate
gcloud auth application-default login

# 3. Set quota project (replace with your project ID)
gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project your-project-id

# 4. Set the environment variable
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="your-project-id"   # Linux/macOS
$env:GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="your-project-id"     # Windows PowerShell

# 5. Test it
patent-creator check-bigquery
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows-specific setup notes</strong></summary>

**Git Bash is required** for the `claude mcp add` command on Windows. Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and set the path:

```bash
# In your .env file
CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH=C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe
```

**Use forward slashes in MCP config paths.** The setup wizard handles this, but if you're configuring manually:

```bash
# Correct
claude mcp add ... -- "C:/Users/YourName/venv/Scripts/python.exe"

# Wrong (will fail)
claude mcp add ... -- "C:\Users\YourName\venv\Scripts\python.exe"
```

</details>

## Performance

| Operation | Time | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **MPEP Search** | 50-200ms | Hybrid FAISS + BM25 |
| **BigQuery Patent Search** | 1-3 sec | 100M+ patents |
| **USPTO API** | 500ms - 2s | Rate-limited by USPTO |
| **Index Build (GPU)** | 3-5 min | NVIDIA CUDA 12.8 |
| **Index Build (Apple Silicon)** | 8-12 min | MPS acceleration |
| **Index Build (CPU)** | 25-35 min | No GPU |

Resource usage: the loaded search index takes about 2-4GB of RAM and the index files are 500MB-1GB on disk. If you have a GPU, it'll use 1-2GB of VRAM for acceleration.

## Known Issues

> **This project is a work in progress.** Most features work, but expect some rough edges. Contributions, issues, and PRs are welcome.

Things to be aware of:

- **PyTorch install order matters.** Install PyTorch before `sentence-transformers`, or you'll end up with CPU-only PyTorch even on a GPU system. The setup wizard handles this, but it can bite you on manual installs.
- **BigQuery requires a Google Cloud project** with billing enabled. The patent data itself is free to query within the BigQuery free tier.
- **Some diagram types need Graphviz installed** as a system package (not just the Python bindings).
- **HyDE query expansion requires API keys** (Anthropic or OpenAI). It's optional and off by default.
- **Windows users need Git Bash** for the `claude mcp add` command. See [Windows setup notes](#configuration).

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the full troubleshooting guide.

## Glossary

If you're coming from the development side and patent terminology is new (or vice versa), here's a quick reference:

| Term | What it means |
|---|---|
| **MPEP** | Manual of Patent Examining Procedure. The handbook patent examiners use at the USPTO. Think of it as the rulebook. |
| **35 USC** | Title 35 of the United States Code. The federal patent statutes. |
| **37 CFR** | Title 37 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The rules that implement the patent statutes. |
| **USPTO** | United States Patent and Trademark Office. The agency that grants patents. |
| **CPC** | Cooperative Patent Classification. A system for categorizing patents by technology area. |
| **Prior Art** | Anything publicly available before your filing date that's relevant to your invention. Finding it is how you figure out if your idea is actually new. |
| **112(a)** | The section of patent law requiring your application to fully describe and enable the invention. |
| **112(b)** | The section requiring your claims to be definite and clear. |
| **MPEP 608** | The section covering formalities like abstract length, title format, and drawing requirements. |
| **RAG** | Retrieval Augmented Generation. Instead of relying only on what the AI was trained on, it searches a database first and uses those results to give a better answer. |
| **FAISS** | Facebook AI Similarity Search. A fast way to find similar text by comparing mathematical representations of meaning. |
| **BM25** | A text search algorithm that matches exact words and phrases. Works alongside FAISS to catch things vector search might miss. |
| **MCP** | Model Context Protocol. A standard for connecting AI tools to AI models. It's how this system talks to Claude. |
| **IDS** | Information Disclosure Statement. A form listing prior art references you need to disclose to the USPTO. |
