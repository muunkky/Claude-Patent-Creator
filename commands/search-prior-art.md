# Search for Prior Art

Professional patent prior art search with patentability assessment.

## What This Command Does

Executes a systematic 7-step prior art search methodology:

1. **Invention Definition** (2-3 min) - Extract key features
2. **Keyword Strategy** (2-3 min) - Build search terms
3. **Broad Search** (3-5 min) - Cast wide net
4. **CPC Identification** (2-3 min) - Find classifications
5. **Deep CPC Search** (5-10 min) - Thorough classification search
6. **Timeline Analysis** (2-3 min) - Technology evolution
7. **Patentability Report** (5-10 min) - Assessment + recommendations

**Total Time**: 25-45 minutes for thorough search

## Who This Is For

- Inventors before filing
- Patent attorneys/agents
- Companies conducting due diligence
- Researchers checking novelty
- Anyone assessing patentability

## Process

### Step 1: Tell Me About Your Invention

I'll ask you:
- What problem does it solve?
- How does it work?
- What are the key features?
- What makes it novel?

Example:
```
> Describe your invention...

User: A blockchain-based authentication system that uses
distributed ledger verification instead of centralized
password databases.

> Got it. Key features I extracted:
> - Blockchain technology
> - Authentication/verification
> - Distributed ledger
> - No centralized database
>
> Is this correct? Any other key features?
```

### Step 2: Keyword Search

I'll search BigQuery (76M+ patents) using keywords derived from your description:

```python
# I'll run searches like:
"blockchain authentication"
"distributed ledger verification"
"decentralized identity"
"cryptographic authentication"
```

I'll review 20-30 results per query and identify the most relevant patents.

### Step 3: CPC Classification Search

I'll:
- Extract CPC codes from relevant patents found
- Identify primary classification areas
- Search thoroughly within those classifications

Common CPC codes:
- G06F: Computing/data processing
- H04L: Digital communication
- G06Q: Business methods
- G06N: AI/neural networks

### Step 4: Timeline Analysis

I'll analyze:
- When was this technology first patented?
- How has it evolved over time?
- What are recent developments (last 2 years)?
- Are there filing trends?

### Step 5: Patentability Assessment

I'll evaluate:

**Novelty (35 USC 102)**:
- Is there an exact match in prior art?
- What are the differences?
- Novelty Score: High/Medium/Low

**Non-Obviousness (35 USC 103)**:
- Could references be combined?
- Is there motivation to combine?
- Are there unexpected results?
- Obviousness Risk: High/Medium/Low

### Step 6: Generate Report

I'll create a comprehensive report with:
- Executive summary
- Top 10 most relevant prior art (ranked)
- Detailed analysis of each reference
- Patentability assessment
- Claim strategy recommendations
- IDS list for USPTO filing

## Requirements

**Must Have**:
1. **BigQuery Access**:
   - Google Cloud project
   - BigQuery API enabled
   - Authenticated: `gcloud auth application-default login`
   - Environment: `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id`

**Optional**:
