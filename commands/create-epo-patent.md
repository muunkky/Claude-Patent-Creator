# Create EPO Patent Application

Guides you through creating a complete European patent application compliant with the EPC.

## What This Command Does

Orchestrates the complete EPO patent application creation process:

1. **Prior Art Search** (15-30 min)
2. **Claims Drafting** (30-60 min)
3. **Specification Writing** (60-120 min)
4. **Diagrams Generation** (15-30 min)
5. **EPO Compliance Checking** (15-20 min)
6. **Final Assembly** (10-15 min)

**Total Time**: 2.5-4.5 hours for complete EP utility patent application

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Invention Information

I'll interview you about your invention:
- What problem does it solve?
- How does it work (high-level)?
- What are the key components or steps?
- What makes it novel/different from the closest prior art?
- Are there any working prototypes or examples?
- Is this a direct EP filing or Euro-PCT national phase entry?

### Step 2: Prior Art Search

I'll search for relevant prior art using:
- **BigQuery** (100M+ worldwide patents, filter country="EP" for EP patents)
- **EPO OPS API** (European patent register, full-text EP documents)
- **CPC classification** search focused on EPO-heavy technology areas

**Deliverable**: Prior art search report with novelty/inventive step assessment

### Step 3: Draft Claims (EPO Format)

I'll draft claims following EPO requirements:

**Independent Claims** (Rule 43(1) EPC):
- Two-part form: preamble + "characterised in that" + characterizing portion
- Based on closest prior art identified in Step 2
- Clear, concise, supported by description (Art. 84 EPC)

**Dependent Claims**:
- Proper back-references
- Further technical features
- Fallback positions for prosecution

**Claim Categories**:
- Product/apparatus claims
- Method/process claims
- Use claims (where appropriate)
- No method-of-treatment claims (Art. 53(c) EPC)

**Deliverable**: Complete claims section (15-25 claims, EPO two-part form)

### Step 4: Write Specification (Rule 42 EPC)

I'll write the description following EPO section order:

1. **Title** - Clear, concise, matches claims scope
2. **Technical Field** - Art to which the invention relates
3. **Background Art** - Prior art documents with citations (D1, D2...)
4. **Technical Problem** - Problem-solution approach (EPO standard)
5. **Disclosure of the Invention** - How the invention solves the problem
6. **Brief Description of Drawings** - Figure list
7. **Detailed Description** - At least one embodiment in detail
8. **Industrial Applicability** - If not obvious from description

**Key EPO Differences**:
- Problem-solution approach is central
- Prior art must be cited in description
- Best mode not strictly required (unlike USPTO)
- Industrial applicability section may be needed
- Reference signs in claims correspond to description/drawings

**Deliverable**: Complete specification (20-50 pages, EPO format)

### Step 5: Generate Diagrams

I'll create patent figures following Rule 46 EPC:
- No text in drawings (except single words like "water", "steam")
- Reference numbers matching description
- A4 format with EPO margin requirements
- Black lines, sufficiently dense

**Deliverable**: 3-10 patent figures (SVG/PNG)

### Step 6: EPO Compliance Check

I'll validate the complete application:
- Run EPO claims analysis (Art. 84 EPC - clarity, conciseness, support)
- Check description format (Rule 42 EPC)
- Verify formalities (Rules 42-49 EPC)
- Check for excluded subject matter (Art. 52(2), Art. 53 EPC)
- Fix any critical issues found

**Deliverable**: EPO compliance report + fixes

### Step 7: Assemble Filing Package

I'll create the final EP filing package:
- Description (Rule 42 format)
- Claims (Rule 43 two-part form)
- Abstract (Rule 47, max 150 words)
- Drawings (Rule 46 compliant)
- Request for Grant (Form 1001 guidance)
- Priority document references
- Fee calculation

**Deliverable**: EPO-ready filing package

## Requirements

Before running this command:

1. **MPEP/EPC Index Built**:
   - Run `/setup-patent-system` first (one-time)

2. **BigQuery Configured** (for patent search):
   - Google Cloud project created
   - BigQuery API enabled
   - Authenticated: `gcloud auth application-default login`
   - Environment variable: `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id`

3. **Graphviz Installed** (for diagrams):
   - Windows: `choco install graphviz`
   - Linux: `sudo apt install graphviz`
   - Mac: `brew install graphviz`

## Options

You can customize the process:

**Filing Route**:
- **Direct EP**: File directly at EPO
- **Euro-PCT**: Enter European regional phase from PCT application

**Scope**:
- **Quick**: Minimal claims + specification outline
- **Standard** (default): Complete application
- **Comprehensive**: Multiple embodiments + extensive examples

**Prior Art Depth**:
- **Basic**: Keywords only (15 min)
- **Standard** (default): Keywords + CPC + EPO OPS (30 min)
- **Thorough**: Extended CPC search + patent family analysis (60 min)

## Example Usage

## What You'll Have at the End

A complete, EPO-ready patent application package including:
- Prior art search with EP-focused results
- Novelty and inventive step assessment (EPO problem-solution approach)
- 15-25 claims in two-part form (validated for Art. 84 EPC)
- 20-50 page specification in Rule 42 EPC format
- 3-10 figures compliant with Rule 46 EPC
- Abstract (max 150 words, Rule 47 EPC)
- Form 1001 guidance and fee calculation
- Compliance reports (all EPO checks passed)
- Complete filing package ready to submit

## Next Steps After Command

1. **Review** complete application with European Patent Attorney
2. **File** via EPO Online Filing (eOLF) or postal
3. **Pay** filing and search fees (within 1 month)
4. **Receive** European search report (typically 6-12 months)
5. **Request examination** (within 6 months of search report publication)
6. **Respond** to examination communications (I can help with that too)

## Tips

- **Problem-solution approach**: Central to EPO prosecution - frame everything around the technical problem and its solution
- **Two-part form**: Identify closest prior art early and structure claims accordingly
- **No method-of-treatment**: Unlike USPTO, EPO excludes methods of treatment (Art. 53(c))
- **Technical effect for software**: Computer-implemented inventions must show "further technical effect"
- **Cite prior art in description**: EPO requires prior art references in the background section
