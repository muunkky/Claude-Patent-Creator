# PCT Formalities Check

Verify all formal requirements for a PCT international application under PCT Rules 5-12.

**Check Type:** $ARGUMENTS

## What I'll Check

1. **Request Form** (Rule 4 PCT) - Form PCT/RO/101, designations, priority claims
2. **Description** (Rule 5 PCT) - Required sections, manner of description
3. **Claims** (Rule 6 PCT) - Numbering, form, unity of invention (Rule 13 PCT)
4. **Abstract** (Rule 8 PCT) - Max 150 words, figure designation
5. **Drawings** (Rule 11 PCT) - Technical standards, margins, paper size
6. **Sequence Listings** (Rule 12 PCT) - If applicable (WIPO Standard ST.26)
7. **Physical Requirements** (Rule 11 PCT) - Paper, margins, font, numbering
8. **Unity of Invention** (Rule 13 PCT) - Single general inventive concept
9. **Fees** - International filing fee, search fee, transmittal fee
10. **Language** (Rule 12 PCT) - Accepted languages per Receiving Office

Specified check type focuses on that requirement; otherwise checks everything.

## Process

1. Ask for application sections (or read from file)
2. Check each PCT formality requirement
3. Search PCT rules and Administrative Instructions
4. Generate compliance report with:
   - Requirements checklist per rule
   - Non-compliance issues with rule citations
   - Fix instructions
   - Pre-filing checklist for PCT
